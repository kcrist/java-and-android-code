so how it works is that 
gets query,passes to query handler
query handler does all the searching for file, makes packet,
double checks the queryid,makes sure there's no repeats
ttl is controlled
packet gets passed along

if it gets a query input, passes along to thread
thread parses header, passes along to queryhandler
query handler does its job
packet gets passes along

note: old = query received as packet at this node
and new = a query that originated at this node
also, you have to make a query search for something first,
before the server starts
its hardcoded for one other node
there are slightly different unix and windows versions


packet form
queryid\n
ttl\n
hops\n
source\n
query\n
